# Hipcam Server RTSP Crash Vulnerability Exploit

Exploit Script for RTSP Service Buffer Overflow in Hipcam Server

**Description**
This script is designed to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) service of the Hipcam Server. The vulnerability arises from inadequate input validation and handling of the 'client_port' parameter in the RTSP SETUP request.

**Vulnerability Details**
The 'client_port' parameter in the RTSP SETUP request is manipulated by setting it to a specific value (overflow = 1749281), aiming to cause a buffer overflow in the RTSP server. If the server does not properly validate or sanitize this input, it may lead to a buffer overflow. Buffer overflows occur when an application writes more data to a buffer than it can handle, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions. In this case, the goal is to overwrite critical data structures or execute arbitrary code, leading to service disruption or unauthorized access.

**Exploitation Steps**
1. Formulate an RTSP URL for the target server.
2. Craft an RTSP SETUP request with a manipulated 'client_port' parameter.
3. Establish a connection to the RTSP service on the target server.
4. Send the crafted RTSP request to the server, attempting to trigger the buffer overflow.
