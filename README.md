# Hipcam Server RTSP Crash Vulnerability Exploit

**Exploit Script for RTSP Service Format Validation Vulnerability in Hipcam Servers.**

## Description
This script exploits a format validation vulnerability in the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) service of the Hipcam Server, stemming from inadequate input validation and handling of the 'client_port' parameter in the RTSP SETUP request.

## Vulnerability Details
The 'client_port' parameter in the RTSP SETUP request is manipulated, inducing a vulnerability in the RTSP server's format validation. Unlike conventional exploits with a specific overflow value, this vulnerability is triggered by improper formatting, particularly when the 'client_port' is not in the expected format (e.g., client_port=[port]-[port+1]). Format validation vulnerabilities occur when an application fails to properly validate or handle input, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. In this case, the goal is to disrupt the service.

## Exploitation Steps
1. Formulate an RTSP URL for the target server.
2. Craft an RTSP SETUP request with a manipulated 'client_port' parameter (ensure it is not in the expected format).
3. Establish a connection to the RTSP service on the target server.
4. Send the crafted RTSP request to the server, attempting to trigger the format validation vulnerability.

## Impact
Upon successful exploitation, the RTSP stream is offline for approximately 45 seconds. This disruption could be leveraged in physical attack scenarios where temporary unavailability of surveillance footage may provide an opportunity for unauthorized access or other malicious activities.
