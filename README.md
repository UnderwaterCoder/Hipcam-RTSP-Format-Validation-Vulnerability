# Hipcam Server RTSP Crash Vulnerability Exploit

**Exploit Script for RTSP Service Buffer Overflow in Hipcam Server**

## Description
This script exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) service of the Hipcam Server, stemming from inadequate input validation and handling of the 'client_port' parameter in the RTSP SETUP request.

## Vulnerability Details
The 'client_port' parameter in the RTSP SETUP request is manipulated, inducing a buffer overflow in the RTSP server. Unlike conventional exploits with a specific overflow value, this vulnerability is triggered by improper formatting, particularly when the 'client_port' is not in the expected format (e.g., client_port=[port]-[port+1]). Buffer overflows occur when an application writes more data to a buffer than it can handle, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions. The objective is to overwrite critical data structures or execute arbitrary code, leading to service disruption or unauthorized access.

## Exploitation Steps
1. Formulate an RTSP URL for the target server.
2. Craft an RTSP SETUP request with a manipulated 'client_port' parameter (ensure it is not in the expected format).
3. Establish a connection to the RTSP service on the target server.
4. Send the crafted RTSP request to the server, attempting to trigger the buffer overflow.

## Impact
Upon successful exploitation, the RTSP stream is offline for approximately 45 seconds. This disruption could be leveraged in physical attack scenarios where temporary unavailability of surveillance footage may provide an opportunity for unauthorized access or other malicious activities.
